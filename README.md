# the-white-rabbit
Hyper Island Project 2
We are planning on creating a game with an unclickable rabbit. 
The game's main focus is to click the rabbit asap and every time the player clicks the rabbit, the rabbit will "run" away, hence the unclickade rabbit. 

A timer will be used to track each time the rabbit is clicked. A small sound will be produced each time it's clicked (possibly homer simpson dough sound) to make the player frustrated. 

An idea is every 20sec the rabbit will be clickable for a sec and a stressful sound will be produced. If the plyaer fails to press the rabbit, the rabbit keeps on moving and becomes unclickable again. 

A design idea is to to have the Matrix code rain in the background and to have the rabbit as a gif, and the gif will start on every click and will "run" away to a new randomized position.
