# the-white-rabbit
Hyper Island Project 2
We are planning on creating a game with an clickable rabbit. 
The game's main focus is to click the rabbit asap and every time the player clicks the rabbit, the rabbit will "run" away. 

A timer will be used to track each time the rabbit is clicked. A small sound will be produced each time it's clicked (possibly a Matrix themed sound) to make the player frustrated. 

An idea is every ...sec the rabbit will be clickable for a sec and a stressful sound will be produced. If the plyaer fails to press the rabbit, the rabbit keeps on moving and appear somwhere else. 

A design idea is to to have the Matrix code rain in the background and to have the rabbit as a gif, and the gif will start on every click and will "run" away to a new randomized position.
